Controller = Router in term of Express
In the context of Express.js and many web frameworks, the terms "controller" and "router" are often used interchangeably, but they have slightly different meanings.

Controller:

A controller typically refers to the logic that handles requests, interacts with the model (for data), and sends an appropriate response. It represents the application's business logic.
In MVC architecture, a controller is responsible for receiving user input, processing it, and updating the model and view accordingly.
In Express, a controller is often implemented as a set of route handling functions that are responsible for processing specific routes.
Router:

A router in Express is a middleware that can be used to group route handlers under a common path prefix. It allows you to modularize your route handling.
A router can contain one or more route handling functions, effectively serving as a mini-controller for a specific set of routes.
It helps in organizing code and makes it more maintainable, especially in larger applications.
In your Express application, a controller can be implemented using a combination of route handling functions, and these route handling functions can be organized into routers for better structure and modularity.

So, while a controller often refers to the logical processing unit for a set of related routes, a router is a mechanism in Express that helps you organize and group those routes together.

In summary, in Express, a router can be seen as a way to implement controllers in a modular and organized fashion. The controller logic is expressed through the route handling functions within the router.
